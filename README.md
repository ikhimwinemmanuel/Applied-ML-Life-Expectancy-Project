# Life Expectancy Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies regression-based machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy using global health, economic, and demographic data.

##  Project Overview

- **Domain:** Healthcare Analytics / Public Health
- **Goal:** Predict life expectancy based on socio-economic and health indicators
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models Evaluated:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR

## Files Included
- `Applied Machine Learning Project - Ikhimwin Emmanuel.pdf`:=> Full technical report.
- `Life_Expectancy_Data.csv`: Dataset sourced from WHO/Kaggle.
- `Life_Expectancy_Regression_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete model workflow and visualizations.

## Key Achievements
- Achieved RMSE ≤ 1.52 years using tuned Random Forest
- Cleaned, encoded, scaled, and engineered features for model input
- Used pipelines and cross-validation for robust performance

## Dataset Summary
- **Source:** [Kaggle WHO Life Expectancy Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
- **Years Covered:** 2000–2015
- **Countries:** 193
- **Rows:** 2,938

## Machine Learning Techniques used
